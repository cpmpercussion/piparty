# piparty

A duo [raspberry pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) performance by Paul Heslin and Charles Martin. Two tiny computers, no screens, one feedback loop. Hopefully nothing crashes. Every Wednesday Paul and Charles grab lunch and say "Hey, we should do a raspberry pi performance somtime." Well now it's on.
